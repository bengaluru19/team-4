Summary
Our project automates the entire on-boarding and design proposal phase. The team at Anthill Creations will not have to click a single button until the designs have been proposed. We have designed a web-based platform containing registration and survey pages for the client to fill. In the back end, we have a MySQL server running which stores all the details of the client, it stores the designs owned by Anthill Creations and more. Our python script automates the email responses at the welcome stage and at the design proposal stage. We have an additional ML module which can make design predictions after the dataset has been populated.
